Dependency:
=================
python2.7 python-pip requests

	sudo apt-get install python-pip
	sudo pip install requests

How to build:
=================
    Build from source code: 
        sudo python setup.py build

How to install:
=================
    Install testkit lite  from source code: 
        sudo python setup.py install

How to use:
=================
    At first, install a test package or prepare one tests.xml file aligned with schema files: /opt/testkit/lite/xsd/testdefinition-syntax.xsd.

    And then,
        1) You can run case on target:
            For web test cases:
                testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" -e 'WRTLauncher <package_name>'
            For native test cases:
                testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" 

        2) You can run case in single mode :
            For web test cases:
                testkit-lite -f "<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" -e 'WRTLauncher <package_name>' --comm localhost
            For native test cases:
                testkit-lite -f "<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" --comm localhost
    
        3) You can select on parser engine to simply conduct one or more tests.xml on target:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name1>/tests.xml ... <somewhere>/<package_namen>/tests.xml" -e 'WRTLauncher <package_name1> ... <package_namen>'
 
        4) If you want to execute both auto and manual tests:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml"
            
        5) If you just want to execute manual tests:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" -M
            
        6) If you just want to execute auto tests:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" -A
            
        7) If you want to save test result to another file, by default it'll be under /opt/testkit/lite/latest:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" -o <somewhere>/xxx.xml
            
        8) If you want to choose some filters:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" --status level1 --type type1 ...

        9) If you want to run test according capability:
            testkit-lite -f device:"<somewhere>/<package_name>/tests.xml" --capability capability.xml
            
        10) At last, you can freely compose the above parameters together:
             testkit-lite -f <somewhere1>/tests.xml <somewhere2>/tests.xml -A --priority P1 --type type1 ...

Get Results:
=================

    Test report will be generated as tests.result.xml   
	The result will be under /opt/testkit/lite/latest after execution, you can also check the history results in /opt/testkit/lite/yyyy-mm-dd-HH:MM:SS.NNNNNN.

View Results:
=================

Test report can be viewed in HTML format, so the data in the xml result file looks more human friendly.

Please follow the following steps to view test report:
    1) copy files: application.js back_top.png jquery.min.js testresult.xsl tests.css under directory /opt/testkit/lite/xsd/
    2) put the files from step 1) under the same directory as the xml result file
    3) open xml result file with a web browser(IE, Chrome or Firefox)
